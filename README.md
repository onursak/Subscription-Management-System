# Subscription-Management-System

Subscription Management System is the web application that allows users to add new offer, good, person, subscriber and subscription to the system.
In addition to these functionalities, users of the system also can assign offers to the subscribers. Users of the system can be call center staff or similar person in the GSM operator company. So, this application is not used by the subscribers. This source code only contains backend side.
Backend side was implemented with Java by using frameworks such as Spring Boot and Hibernate. This is the project that I developed during my 6 weeks internship in Ericsson. In first two weeks, software requirements was analyzed and technologies such as Spring Boot and Hibernate were learned. And in the following weeks, the project was implemented.
